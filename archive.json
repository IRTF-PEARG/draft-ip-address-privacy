These merit strong privacy protections.\r\n\r\nPublic interactions are interactions where a user acts in full public view, for example, publishing an article in a newspaper. Individuals acting in public do not expect their actions to be private. However the public expects accountability for public safety when individuals act in public.\r\n\r\nSystems that layer privacy onto public interactions create public safety risk while disrupting accountability. Such systems disrupt the incentive for socially responsible behavior, making them dangerous.\r\n\r\nA library is an example of a system that has evolved to apply privacy and accountability. Users can consult library materials with a useful measure of anonymity and privacy. At the same time, the material in the library almost alway practices identity transparency of authors and publishers, and it is not okay for the contents of the library to be anonymously modified (e.g. updating the contents of a book), or slanted through censorship or other manipulation.\r\n\r\nAnother example is academic publishing. Consider how transparent identity in academic publishing supports the advancement of science. Would academic publishing work if it were anonymous? ",

I agree, in general, about replicating (and enhancing) the privacy and safety we have in physical spaces.\r\n\r\nThere are certainly examples of privacy being necessary for honesty and accountability, as you alluded to (e.g., whistleblowers, political dissidents, human rights defenders, assault/abuse reporters). We know safety nets within society are abused when they are available, and some misuse and deception must be tolerated if the system exists. The threshold of allowed abuse should depend on other factors (e.g., impact/harm resulting from said abuse). I don't know of a specific argument that privacy favors honesty, but I don't know of an argument for privacy favoring deception, either. However, we do know that privacy and security are human rights, and we should therefore build systems that protect people from arbitrary privacy invasion while still limiting deception/misuse/abuse within and of the systems.\r\n\r\nI interpret \"Identity Transparency\" as meaning \"revealing the identity of the person who is taking, or responsible for, a specific action\". If this is correct, then I agree this transparency can be used for holding people accountable. However, we know that neither retroactive attribution nor up-front identification was sufficient deterrence in multiple well known cases over the last few years, so we should not presume this is a \"silver bullet\" of dishonesty or malicious activity online.\r\n\r\nI think we need a more precise definition and understanding of public safety before we can discuss requirements/expectations associated with it. I am concerned that vague descriptions of public safety will only lead to ineffective mitigations/solutions while creating data-lakes of personal information.\r\n\r\nI suspect that separating public safety from law enforcement will be important. however in some cases supporting public safety may require cooperating with law enforcement to some extent.\r\n\r\nWould looking at a few specific (offline and online) examples be helpful for describing their responsibility with respect to public safety, and then we can try extrapolating from there? Looking at what technology has done for privacy and safety may be helpful, too, so we have a shared foundation.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure working through all of this in comments on an Issue is the best work flow. Should we try drafting another document for these descriptions as a supplement to the original IP address privacy draft? I think this is an important subject, but these details are tangential to the goals of the original draft.",

In a platform that supports both anonymity and identity transparency, transparent actors are accountable, so they are subject to incentives for truth and honesty, and are incrementally more trustworthy.\r\n\r\nYour suggestion to explore examples and consider another doc are reasonable.

      "body": "As siloed defenses against abuse have improved, abusers have moved to multi-platform threat models. For example, a public discussion platform with a culture of anonymity may redirect traffic to YouTube as a video library, bypassing YouTube defenses that otherwise reduce exposure of potentially harmful content. Similarly, a minor could be solicited by an adult impersonating a child on a popular social media platform, then redirected to a smaller, less established and less defended platform where illegal activity could occur. There are many such cross-platform abuse models and they cause significant public harm. In a world with strong cross-platform privacy barriers, how should such threats be managed?\r\n",

If I understand correctly, at a minimum, the service provider (Youtube) only see the client's IP address and possibly a referrer. In a world with IP address privacy, the service won't see the client's true IP address and the browser may truncate the referrer. Are there specific mitigations you already have in place for this situation that you can describe?\r\n\r\nFor the second example, while these platforms should provide some oversight/protection within their walls, they cannot and should not be responsible for potential harm that occurs on other sites. In general, protecting a child is their guardian/parent's responsibility, and this is the case regardless of which site they're on.\r\n\r\nBased on these two examples, I'm not sure there is a one-size-fits-all answer for this problem.

Without a proxy, YouTube could better estimate the number of distinct users, geographic distribution, and other useful demographics. This isn't really about specific mitigations, it is more about the investigation that supports understanding a threat and designing specific mitigations. In the extreme, abuse fighting is reduced to waiting for a disaster and then cleaning up the mess. This is not a good outcome for public safety. There is no single counterabuse signal more important than IP address.\r\n\r\nThe above assumes high-traffic volumes. I think the second example is representative of the low-traffic case. \r\n\r\nFor the second example, parents have a responsibility for being responsible parents. Governments have a responsibility for making responsible parenting possible. When the environment for parenting includes features that are particularly dangerous, and that are harming children, at a certain point a legitimate government is compelled to mitigate the danger, lest they lose the confidence of the people. Such government interventions can avoided if the systems in question self regulate. The radio and the printing press are examples of revolutionary technologies that contributed to tremendous disruption and later became safer through regulation and through industry norms.\r\n\r\nThese threat models represent significant public safety risks and harms. Achieving safety is not so simple as IP address transparency, as we have that today, and things are still getting worse. That is driving the industry towards systems that are less available for anonymous, unverified users, a bad outcome for privacy. To preserve anonymous service access we need to recognize and mitigate features that threaten privacy or safety.",

This is the case with credential theft in general and can be protected against with technologies such as WebAuthn and techniques such as 2FA. \r\n\r\nBeing specific about the types of abuse will help us determine the types of preventative measures that may be appropriate.\r\n\r\nI will note that these two categories are intentionally scoped to a single system. There is a third broad category where independant systems can use IP addresses as identifiers to warn others of threats. rfc5782 is one example of a standardized system to share such threat intelligence. This would also include tying an IP address to a real world identity.\r\n\r\nAnd of course if there are other broad categories I'm missing, we should identify and define them.",

Let me quote some bits of my comments there:\r\n\r\n> It seems reasonable to say that the focus of this document is to provide alternatives for the use cases served by cross-site re-identification, but I think it's important to consider the effects of IP privacy on same-site re-identification as well.\r\n> (For context, I work on an anti-abuse product at Shape Security which does exactly this sort of same-site re-identification.)\r\n> Cookies are opt-in, so that's not particularly viable as an anti-abuse mechanism, particularly if account takeover or denial of service is in scope.\r\n> [...]\r\n> Attackers need to not be able to opt out of sending the signal. Or rather, real users need to opt out so infrequently that outright blocking anyone who does not send it is acceptable. Cookies don't work here because any first-time visitor will lack cookies for the site, which means you can't simply block anyone who lacks cookies.\r\n\r\nThere's some discussion in that thread about the feasibility of a mechanism which required the server to request some additional signal from the client, which I won't copy over, but we can continue discussing it here.

The draft envisioned some amount of transparency and appeal process built in to the system. Recently, this draft is now focusing broadly on a toolbox of replacement signals - each signal replaces some use case of IP addresses. However, where reputation fits into this new collection of signals is not clear, and the breadth/scale of such a reputation system isn't clear either, nor is it clear if such a system is desirable in reality.",

In that case, I think we should rephrase this definition so it's clearer.",

They should be easy to approve.\n(2) Could you reformat the IP Privacy Law section into more of a table? It'd be nice to note the key points of overlap and difference between the 6 locales discussed in a more focused way. The table format would also be easy to expand as future jurisdictions adopt relevant law.\n\nThanks for contributing this!",
